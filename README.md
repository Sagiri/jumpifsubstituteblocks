## JumpIfSubstituteBlocks

Adds a new command for move scripts, `jumpifsubstituteblocks` to Fire Red. Substitute does not block moves that are sound-based or coming from a Pok√©mon with the ability Infiltrator.

### What do I do before I build this?

If necessary, change `move_cmds` in `constants.s`. The given address of this table is for MrDollSteak's patch, so if it is there, you will not need to modify this. This is the table of commands for move scripts (e.g. `attackcanceler` and `attackstring`).

Update `ATK_JUMPIFSUBSTITUTEBLOCKS` in `constants.s`. It will need an unused move script command id.

If necessary, change `moveids_sound_based` in `constants.s`. The given address of this table is for MrDollSteak's patch, so if it is there, you will not need to modify this. This is the table of moves that are sound-based (e.g. Hyper Voice and Growl).

Sound-based moves only started bypassing Substitute in Gen VI. If you don't like that change, you can set `SOUND_BYPASSES_SUBSTITUTE` to `false` in `src/global.h`.

Change `ABILITY_INFILTRATOR` in `src/defines/abilities.h` to match what it is in your ROM. You should set this to `0xFFFF` if you don't have Infiltrator in your ROM.

The build script will search for adequate free space, but if you need to insert the code in a particular place, you can tell it where to start looking by modifying `free-space` in `config.ini`. If the given address is acceptable (i.e. is word-aligned and has enough bytes of free space), it will be inserted there.

### How do I build this?

### What do I do after I build this?

The syntax in your move script is just `jumpifsubstituteblocks ptr`. It'll be stepped over and do nothing if Substitute doesn't block; it it does block, script execution will continue from `ptr`.

In order to use it in BSP, you'll need to add `#command jumpifbattleover ATK_JUMPIFSUBSTITUTEBLOCKS 0x1  "Offset to possibly jump to" 0x4` to BSP's `commands.bsh`. Don't literally include `ATK_JUMPIFSUBSTITUTEBLOCKS` here; replace it with whatever value you chose.

This also patches a number of existing functions that check for the Substitute status so that they instead check if Substitute should block the move instead. However, scripts for moves are untouched and may still check simply for whether Substitute is active (they should be updated to use `jumpifsubstituteblocks` instead).
